# Lyrics Menu Bar

A lightweight native macOS menu bar app that shows time-synced lyrics for the song currently playing in **Spotify** or **Apple Music** — no login, no API key, no setup beyond a couple of clicks.

Built natively with Swift + AppKit. Uses ~50 MB of RAM, negligible CPU.

### 3. Iimportant!

Because this app is open-source and not paid into Apple's $99/year developer program, macOS will refuse to open it the first time and show a warning like:

> *"LyricsMenuBar" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.*

That's just macOS being cautious — it doesn't mean anything is wrong.

## How It Works

- Reads the current track, artist, and playback position via AppleScript from whichever app is active (Spotify or the macOS Music app).
- If both are running, prefers the one that is actually playing.
- Fetches synced lyrics from [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) (falls back to plain lyrics with estimated timing when no synced version exists).
- Updates the menu bar title in real time as the song progresses.

## Menu Actions

Click the lyric in the menu bar to open the menu:

| Item | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Now Playing** | Shows the current track and source (`[Spotify]` or `[Music]`). |
| **Refresh Lyrics** | Force a refetch — useful when the wrong song was matched. |
| **Quit** | Quit the app. |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing appears in the menu bar.**
Check the process is running: open Terminal and run `pgrep -f LyricsMenuBar`. If it's empty, launch the app from `/Applications` again and watch for any macOS dialogs.

**Title stuck at "Loading lyrics…".**
The track probably isn't on lrclib.net. Click the icon → **Refresh Lyrics**. Or test the API in Terminal:

```bash
curl "https://lrclib.net/api/get?track_name=SONG&artist_name=ARTIST&duration=240"
```

If it returns `404`, the song isn't in lrclib's database yet — you can [contribute it](https://lrclib.net/publish).

**Title shows "♪ (no lyrics found)".**
Same as above — lrclib doesn't have lyrics for that track yet.

**"LyricsMenuBar" can't control Spotify / Music.**
Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation** and tick the **Spotify** (and/or **Music**) checkbox under `LyricsMenuBar`. If you don't see it listed, quit and relaunch the app — macOS will prompt again.

**Lyrics are out of sync.**
- For synced LRC lyrics, timing comes from lrclib — try **Refresh Lyrics**; a better version may exist.
- For plain lyrics (fallback), the app distributes lines evenly across the track duration, so accuracy is approximate.

## Build from Source (for developers)

### Requirements

- macOS 12 (Monterey) or newer
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadialvy/spotify-lyrics-menubar.git
cd spotify-lyrics-menubar
./build.sh
```

This:
1. Runs `swift build -c release`
2. Assembles `LyricsMenuBar.app`
3. Ad-hoc code signs it
4. Produces `LyricsMenuBar.dmg` for distribution

To skip the DMG step (faster during development): `./build.sh --no-dmg`

### Project Layout

└── LyricsMenuBar.app/                       # Built bundle (gitignored)
```

### Configuration

Tweak the constants at the top of [`Sources/LyricsMenuBar/MenuBarController.swift`](Sources/LyricsMenuBar/MenuBarController.swift):

| Constant | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `placeholder` | Text shown when nothing is playing |
| `maxChars` | Max characters shown in the menu bar before truncation |
| `pollInterval` | How often (seconds) to poll the player and refresh the lyric line |

To add or remove player sources, edit `PlayerReader.players` in [`Sources/LyricsMenuBar/PlayerReader.swift`](Sources/LyricsMenuBar/PlayerReader.swift). Rebuild after editing.

## Notes

- Lyrics availability depends on the [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) community database; some tracks may not be found.
- The app polls Spotify/Music locally via AppleScript — your listening data never leaves your machine.
- CPU usage is negligible (~0.4%); memory is ~50 MB resident.
- Built with Swift 6 + AppKit. No Python, no Electron, no Node.
